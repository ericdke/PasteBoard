A prototype app for OS X, in Swift, for managing a list of copy/paste actions (clipboard manager).

Copy text and images anywhere in your Mac and they will be added in our app, ready to be reused later.

It works very well, and there's already a few goodies, for example ignoring forbidden apps like 1Password, but it's incomplete and there's almost no UI except a simple tableview to list the copied items.

Contributions are welcomed.
