A prototype app for OS X, in Swift, for managing a list of copy/paste actions.

Copy a String (or an image) anywhere in your Mac and it will be listed in our app, ready to be reused later.

Works very well, but is incomplete and there's almost no UI except a simple tableview - contributions are welcomed.
